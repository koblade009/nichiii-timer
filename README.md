## Info: 
Tkinter application Python 3.13.9.
It's just a timer app that I made for myself

## Other files: 
click.wav (tick sound)
timer_state.json (will auto-create if missing)

## Features: 
Work Timer (Blue) with cost calculator, Break Timer (Red), Simple Mode/Full Mode, Stay On Top Toggle, Automatic Save/Load State, Tick Sound Toggle, Resettable Timer

## Additional Notes: 
Put click.wav on the same folder as the exe file if you want ticking sounds.
